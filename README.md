# bs-core-category

This package collects together commonly used interfaces from Category Theory and abstract algebra along with a set of (OCaml) functors designed to make their use straightforward.

The package also contains implementations of these interfaces for a number of types from Bucklescript's standard library, Belt, and some other types missing from that library.
